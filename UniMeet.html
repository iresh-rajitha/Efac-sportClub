                <h3>In University Meet</h3>
                <p>Sri Lanka University Games, or most commonly known as SLUG is one of the major
                    sports festivals that is being organized by SLUSA among Sri Lankan Universities, which is held
                    at a selected university once every 3 years. At our universities, a learning destination for millions
                    of Sri Lankan undergraduates, SLUG is an excellent platform for undergraduates to develop their
                    athletic skills, participate in fairs and showcase their amazing talents and abilities to the world.
                    Though the first SLUG had only 12 events, the number of sports has risen to 22 by today. </p>
                <p>The University of Ruhuna has been actively participating in every SLUG since 1983 and hosted
                    its first SLUG festival in 1998. The 13th SLUG event was proudly hosted by the enthusiastic
                    students and faculties of the University of Ruhuna. </p>
                <p>Winners of the SLUG festival are received that golden opportunity to represent our motherland
                    as university undergraduates in international tournaments such as Asian University
                    Championship and World University Games which are held once every two years. </p>
                <p>We are pleased to say the undergraduates of the University of Ruhuna, are being competitive in
                    SLUG festivals for years and constantly gaining victories in different sports.
                    The famous American baseball player, Babe Ruth once said “It’s hard to beat a person who never
                    gives up”. When it comes to the Faculty of Engineering it is a place where hundreds of
                    undergraduates with the greatest talents, succeeding their lives day by day.
                    It is proven that every year, that talented students in the faculty represented Sri Lanka in the
                    World University Games while making great academic performances. </p>
